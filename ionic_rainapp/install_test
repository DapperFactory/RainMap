To Install and Test:

- Install Ionic View from App/Play Store (this is Alpha, so please be patient)
- Log in using email: lewisdaly@cmu.edu, password: password
- Install and run!

#### NOTES ####
- I will be pushing updates for testing using this - hopefully it works nicely, if not we will find another way (eg. testfairy)
- Ionic View is a little buggy - so there may be some glitches here and there, let me know if you find them, and I will make sure that it is Ionic view that is the issue.
